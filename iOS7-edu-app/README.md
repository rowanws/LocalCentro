This repository belongs to the iOS version of the Centro Mobile App.

It uses **CocoaPods** to manage library dependencies.

For instructions on how to install CocoaPods, please refer to the Official Documentation:

*[Installing RVM.](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)*

*[Installing CocoaPods.](http://cocoapods.org)*

Once Ruby and CocoaPods are installed just go to the App folder in the Terminal and type:

**$ pod install**

Make sure to always open the Xcode workspace instead of the project file when building
your project:

**$ open App.xcworkspace**
